# Data visualisation in Python
In this notebook, you will be practicing the usage of visualizing modules in Python, ```Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly``` again using a given dataset.
 
## data
We will use a car dataset which can<br> be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/autompg-dataset). The dataset contains information about various cars, including their make, model, year, price, and other attributes. Let’s dive into the code<br> and explore different chart types to visualize this dataset effectively

## Goal
You will find a extensive description of the task in the ```Visualisation_Exercise.ipynb``` notebook in this repository. Create the visualizations with 3 libraries, at least one plot with each:
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly

Go through each of the notebook in the order given below:

- [plotly_introduction.ipynb](./plotly_introduction.ipynb)
- [more_on_plotting.ipynb](./more_on_plotting.ipynb)
- [Visualisation_Exercise.ipynb](./Visualisation_Exercise.ipynb)


## Virtual environment
This repo contains a ```requirements.txt``` file with a list of all the packages and dependencies you will need.
In order to install the environment you can use the following commands:
```
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Objective
At the end of this notebok, you will be able to practice:
- the basic usage of different plotting libraries
- creating various plots which convey certain information
