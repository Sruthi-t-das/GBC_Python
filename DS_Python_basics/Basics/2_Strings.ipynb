The reason this <br> matters to us in terms of our Python programs is that, Python expects our strings to be in one of a couple of different encodings<br> (either ```ASCII```, ```utf-8```, or ```unicode```). This isn't something you will run into often, and especially not when defining your own strings<br> (it's probably most prevalent when pulling text from the internet). However, it's worth noting because there is a good chance<br> that sometime in your Python career, you will end up with Python telling you it doesn't recognize a certain character in one of <br> your strings, and an unexpected encoding will most likely be at the heart of that error."
