    "Welcome back to the first Python notebook you will go through during the bootcamp. We hope you have all had a look at the <br> notebooks we shared with you before the course(if not, see **Preparation course** material in Github). In the following notebooks, we<br> will go through all the topics you have already seen in the preparation notebooks to refresh your knowledge. For those of<br> you who have worked with Python before and are comfortable with programming, it might be easy. For some, it may only be the second<br> time they've heard of most of the topics and some of the exercises might already be challenging. That's fine! No one becomes<br> a true Pythonista overnight. To become good at programming, you need one thing above all: practice! And that's why today we<br> will start by reviewing the basics. For some topics, we will dive deeper.<br>\n",
