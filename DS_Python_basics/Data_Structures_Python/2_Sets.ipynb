Take the set of them both and find the intersection of those sets. The most obvious<br> use case is to find the unique items in an iterable. There's also another amazing place where we'll want to use sets that might not be<br> so apparent.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We use a set! The reason why lies in the fact that sets in Python are built very similarly to dictionaries. There's an underlying hash<br> table that allows elements to be stored, and queried for membership in the set (_Note, this means that the elements of a set have to be<br> immutable_). This operation happens much faster with sets than with lists ([here's](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) some coverage on how quickly some Python methods<br> run). Let's take a look at this in action, and simultaneously learn about how to time things in IPython."
