    "### The Magic of Iterables\n",
    "Strings and lists are two kinds of iterables that we have looked at today. There are many other kinds of iterables that we'll work with in<br> Python, and you can even define your own iterable if you'd like. The important thing that we want to note for now, though, is that the ```for```<br> loops that we have looked at today will work for any iterable. You can simply write ```for <variable name> in <iterable>:```, and at each<br> iteration through the loop you will be able to access another element from that iterable via variable name. Also, as mentioned above, the <br>```list()``` constructor accepts any iterable as an argument, and then creates a ```list```, where each element in the iterable is a single<br> element in the ```list```."
