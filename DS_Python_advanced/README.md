# Introduction to Pandas and Numpy
In this repository, we will start with Pandas and Numpy. You have to work on together as pair-programmers. As Data Scientists/Analyst,<br> its important to know how to work in groups. Please make sure you have **forked** the repo and set up a new virtual environment.<br>

For this purpose you use following commands:

```
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br>

The added **requirements file** (```requirements.txt```) 
contains all libraries and dependencies we need to execute.
<br>
At the end of this repo you should

- get why Pandas and Numpy are the two valuable tools for Data Scientists
- be familiar to handle data in Pandas DataFrames and Numpy-Arrays
- know how to combine datasets
- be able to do some Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on a new dataset
- know how to plot some basic plots for better data understanding

Please work on the following files in this repository in the given order below for a better understanding:<br>
