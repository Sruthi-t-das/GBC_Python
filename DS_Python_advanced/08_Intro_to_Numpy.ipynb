In addition, since a NumPy array knows what type each object it is storing is (and those types<br> don't change), it doesn't have to waste time checking what type each object is (like a list).

    "As you might have guessed, we have functionality to create pivot tables available for our use in pandas. The way that we do this is by<br> calling the ```pivot_table()``` function that is available on the pandas module (which we've stored as ```pd```). As the [docs](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html) tell us, the<br> ```pivot_table()``` expects a number of different arguments:"
